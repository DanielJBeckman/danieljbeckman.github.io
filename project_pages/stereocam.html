        <p><strong>StereoCam</strong> was a rugged, field-deployable stereo vision system designed to measure ice jam thickness.
        Built with two Raspberry Pi HQ cameras in a custom waterproof enclosure, the cameras were synchronized via a master Pi node and triggered simultaneously to capture stereo images.
        Using OpenCV2, depth maps were generated from the imagery to analyze above-surface ice mass while paired with a bubbler sensor below.
        Though ultimately damaged during testing, the project proved the feasibility of rapid stereo deployments on dangerous infrastructure.</p>
